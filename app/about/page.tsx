            I am an undergraduate with a growing interest in web development.
                 I have developed a passion for coding and technology.
                  I'm currently working on expanding 
                 my skills in HTML, CSS, Tailwind and Javascript, and I'm exploring the world of full-stack development.
                 As a beginner to intermediate web developer, I enjoy building interactive websites and
                     learning through them, I believe that combining my business knowledge with technical skills will help me make
                      unique choices in the future.
                      I am committed to continuous learning, and I look forward to growing in the world
                         of web development.
